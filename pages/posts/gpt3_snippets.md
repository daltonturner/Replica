# Swift Code Snippets with GPT-3

This post is my first experiment with OpenAI’s [GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/). GPT-3 has been on my radar for several years, but I didn’t pay much attention and didn’t initially sign up for their beta program. Some of my favorite Twitter follows, [Jordan Singer]() and [Simon Willison]() have raved about its abilities, and have even created [products]() using the service. Some tweets and the recent monetization of [GitHub’s Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) feature recently reminded of GPT-3, so I decided to sign up and give it a whirl.

I am learning Swift, and wanted to test providing GPT-3 some prompts to generate code snippets for me. I figured these snippets could be useful to save to Xcode for future use. The results were really cool and really useful.

I wanted to write up some instructions on how to accomplish this so others could take advantage of the API, but thought to myself, “What if I prompted GPT-3 to help me write the post?” So... I decided to get a little bit meta and have GPT-3 write the rest of this post for me! What you’re seeing below is only *slightly* edited output from the _first_ prompt I provided.

The post should be written using markdown formatting and include several sections: an introduction, a section on how to get set up with OpenAI, a section on writing a good prompt for Swift code snippets, and a conclusion summarizing the post.

## Swift Code Snippets with GPT-3

As a developer, you know how important it is to be able to quickly write code that is both correct and efficient. Unfortunately, there are only so many hours in the day, and sometimes it can be difficult to find the time to create new code snippets that you can use in your projects.

Thankfully, there is a solution: GPT-3. GPT-3 is a machine learning platform that can be used to generate Swift code snippets, saving you valuable time in the development process.

In this blog post, we will show you how to get set up with OpenAI, write a good prompt for Swift code snippets, and use GPT-3 to generate time-saving Swift code snippets that you can use in your projects.

### Getting Set Up with OpenAI

OpenAI is the company that created GPT-3. In order to use the platform, you will first need to create an account with OpenAI.

Once you have created an account, you will need to create a new API key. To do this, go to the API Keys section of your account settings and click the “Create New API Key” button.

Enter a name for your key and click the “Create API Key” button. Your new API key will be displayed. Copy this key and save it in a safe place, as you will need it in order to use the GPT-3 platform.

### Writing a Good Prompt for Swift Code Snippets

Now that you have an OpenAI account and API key, you are ready to start using GPT-3. The first step is to write a prompt that will be used to generate your Swift code snippet.

When writing your prompt, there are a few things to keep in mind:
- Be clear and concise. The more specific you are, the better the results will be.
- Include all of the information that you want in the code snippet. The more information you include, the more likely it is that the generated code will be what you are looking for.
- Be realistic in your expectations. GPT-3 is a powerful tool, but it is not perfect. If you are looking for something specific, it is best to be as specific as possible in your prompt. 

With these things in mind, let’s look at an example prompt:

“I want a Swift code snippet that generates a random number between 1 and 10.”

This prompt is clear, concise, and includes all of the information that we want in the code snippet. As a result, it is likely that the generated code will be exactly what we are looking for.

### Using GPT-3 to Generate Swift Code Snippets

Now that you have written your prompt, you are ready to use GPT-3 to generate your Swift code snippet. To do this, go to the GPT-3 playground and paste your prompt into the “Prompt” field. Then, click the “Submit” button. GPT-3 will then generate a Swift code snippet based on your prompt. In this case, the generated code is:

```swift
let number = Int.random(in: 1...10)
```

This code snippet exactly matches the information in our prompt, and it is a valid Swift code snippet that we can use in our projects.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have shown you how to use GPT-3 to generate Swift code snippets. We have also shown you how to get set up with OpenAI and write a good prompt for Swift code snippets.

GPT-3 is a powerful tool that can save you a lot of time in the development process. We encourage you to try it out and see how it can help you in your projects.
