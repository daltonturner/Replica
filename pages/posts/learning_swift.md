# Learning Swift

A few weeks back I joined Cash App as a Software Engineering Apprentice. The goal of the apprenticeship is to spend 6 months upskilling through on-the-job training and self-study. As an Apprentice, I'll be learning Swift and working on Community projects within Cash. 

This is a pretty unique opportunity, so I figured I'd document my progress by working on some side projects. I might mix in some other fun stuff I learn along the way, and share that all here too.

Wish me luck!
