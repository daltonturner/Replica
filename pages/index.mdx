# Dalton Turner

Hi there! My name is Dalton Turner, and this is my personal website and blog. I use this website to write about things I'm learning and love sharing my experiences with others. 

In my professional life, I'm a Junior Software Engineer at [Cash App](https://cash.app/) and have previously worked at [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en). I studied Actuarial Science at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/). 

In my free time, I enjoy surfing, listening to music, and trying out new restaurants. I'm also a technology enthusiast and am currently learning iOS development. 

Thanks for stopping by my site, I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.
